        On this endpoint, a Flexibility Provider can submit his current, live data regarding the flexibility he is actively
        providing. On this endpoint, the reported data implies active action taken on the charging behavior.
        A positive value corresponds to increased charging, where a negative one corresponds to reduced charging.

            UTC normalized start_date, of the values when the demand starts. This does not necessarily have to be for today
            or tomorrow, but can be for any arbitrary date, as long as it is not in the past.

            Contains the exact requests of behavioural change in consumption for a given time slot. The first element
            has (roughly) the same value as `start_date`, but might be rounded up/down to match existing grid data.
