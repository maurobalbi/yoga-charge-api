  title: Flexibility Provider API
  description: |-
    This is the API definition for Flexibility Providers in the YogaCharge research project. This API definition is used
    in combination with an _Electric Peak Shaver_ service, which communicates with the Flexibility Provider to exchange
    flexibility requests and plans.

      summary: Endpoint to request control of flexibilities
      description: |-
        On this endpoint, it is possible to give out a request for flexibility usage. When an _Electric Grid Shaver_
        service calculates consumption changes, that are required to shave a peak, they can use this endpoint to ask
        for flexible loads to be controlled in a specific way. It is important to note that any request to reduce
        consumption has to be fulfilled otherwise, so requests should include timeslots where it is possible to induce
        elevated consumption, to compensate for reduced consumption during other timeslots. The response has to cover
        the same time range as the request did. Meaning in case of the request covering only half an hour, the response
        should do the same.

    error:
      type: object
      properties:
        message:
          type: string
          description: |-
            Describes the error at hand. This should be descriptive enough to enable further actions to be taken.
          required: true
    flexibility_request:
      type: object
      properties:
        start_date:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          description: |-
            Describes the initial start_date, where this request begins. This does not necessarily have to be for today
            or tomorrow, but can be for any arbitrary date, as long as it is in the future. Be aware that requests for
            times that are too close to the _now_ might be ignored, as the flexibility providers might not be able to
            react quickly enough. *It is expected that the given date-time is in UTC!*
          required: true
          example: "2025-09-02T03:00:00Z"
        unit:
          type: string
          enum:
            - KWH
          description: |-
            Defines which unit of measure for the numbers for consumption are in. Note that this defines the numbers
            for all of the values supplied in `requested_flexibility`. Can offer more options in the future.
          required: true
          example: KWH
        interval_unit:
          type: string
          enum:
            - MINUTES
          description: |-
            Denotes the unit of time used to calculate the intervals in the request. Can offer more options in the future.
          required: true
          example: MINUTES
        interval_time:
          type: integer
          minimum: 1
          maximum: 60
          description: |-
            Defines in combination with the field `interval_unit`, how long a value is valid for. Hence if it is 15
            and `interval_unit` is `MINUTES`, it is expected that `requested_flexibility` contains 24*60/15 = 96 elements.
          example: 15
          required: true
        request_identifier:
          type: string
          format: uuid
          required: true
          description: |-
            Identifies this type of request. This is important to allow for correct grouping of messages,
            so that further evaluation can be simplified. It is also a key component required to allow for migration
            towards an async setup.
        requested_flexibility:
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/consumption_interval"
            minItems: 1
          required: true
          description: |-
            Contains the exact requests of behavioural change in consumption for a given time slot. The first element
            has the same value as `start_date`, and each subsequent item is `start_date + i*interval_time`.
    consumption_interval:
      type: object
      properties:
        interval:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          description: |-
            The date-time for this entry in the list. Note that the first element should always be the earliest,
            and that any further elements are to have their `interval` set to the previous `interval + distance`.
          required: true
        request:
          type: number
          format: double
          description: |-
            Defines a numeric amount of energy to be additionally consumed (positive value) or to reduce the consumed
            amount by the given value (negative value).
          required: true
      example: [
        {
          interval: "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
          request: 30.34
        },
        {
          interval: "2025-01-01T00:15:00Z",
          request: 0.884
        },
        {
          interval: "2025-01-01T00:30:00Z",
          request: -15.6482
        }
      ]
    flexibility_response:
      $ref: '#/components/schemas/flexibility_request'
      description: |-
        The response to the `flexibility_request` shares the same requirements. It is important to note, that the
        response attributes should be identical to the ones from the request, _except_ the `request` fields in the
        `requested_flexibility`, which would translate to the actual flexibility the provider can offer.
